# Horiseon Web Services

## Description 

Horiseon needed their website's code refactored as the site was not performing well in Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). This was primarily down to outdated HTML that did not make use of semantic attributes.

This project altered the HTML to make use of these attributes as much as possible, and also cleaned up a number of other parts of the codebase including rationalising the CSS to future-proof the website and increase its SEO performance.

## Installation

THe project is a static webpage hosted on Github Pages so no installation is required apart a web browser of your choice.


## Usage 

The website is a static page and is easy to use. Simply click the navigation links at the top-right of the page to be taken to an article explaining more on that topic.
